Compatibility notes
-------------------

With ASIMOV versions that provide ``PESummaryPipeline``, RIFT retains the
legacy automatic PESummary completion job.  ASIMOV 0.7 and newer manage
PESummary as a separate postprocessing analysis, so RIFT marks the PE analysis
finished and does not submit a duplicate postprocessing job.

``Rift.collect_assets(absolute=True)`` publishes the ``rift-assets/v1``
contract for separate postprocessing adapters: samples (always a list), the
RIFT configuration, PSDs, calibration envelopes, likelihood products, and
basic event/analysis provenance.  Consumers should tolerate additional keys.

Rimsky integration
------------------

The ``rift-rimsky-analysis`` command generates a RIFT follow-up document for
Rimsky's ``sample_sink.asimov_configuration`` hook. It bootstraps from the
PESummary metafile produced by Rimsky's online Bilby analysis and normalizes
Rimsky's underscore-separated prior names for the RIFT template. See
``RIFT/rimsky/README.md`` for configuration and operational details.
