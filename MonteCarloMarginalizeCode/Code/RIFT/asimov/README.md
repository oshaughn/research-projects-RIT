Compatibility notes
-------------------

With ASIMOV versions that provide ``PESummaryPipeline``, RIFT retains the
legacy automatic PESummary completion job.  ASIMOV 0.7 and newer manage
PESummary as a separate postprocessing analysis, so RIFT marks the PE analysis
finished and does not submit a duplicate postprocessing job.

``Rift.collect_assets(absolute=True)`` publishes the ``rift-assets/v1``
contract for separate postprocessing adapters: samples (always a list), the
RIFT configuration, PSDs, calibration envelopes, likelihood products, and
basic event/analysis provenance.  Consumers should tolerate additional keys.
